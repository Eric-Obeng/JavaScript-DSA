  <li>The Problem Statement</li>
  <li>Try solving the Problem</li>
  <li>Implement the solution together</li>
  <li>Determine the Big O of the solution</li>

# Recursion
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem
<h3 align="left">A few points about Recursion </h3>

<ol>
  <li>Every recursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion</li>
  <li>Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution.<br>A recursive solution maybe far worse compared to an iterative solution</li>
  <li>Recursion is a topic that is not the most straight forward to understand. Do not give up if you struggle with the concept.</li>
</ol>

# Search Algorithms
